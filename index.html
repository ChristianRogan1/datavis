<h1>Global Agriculture</h1>
<p>Agriculture is vital for sustaining human life and global economies. It provides nutrition and raw 
    materials needed for everyday life and industrial processes. Beyond its economic significance, 
    agriculture plays a critical role in rural developement and employment. Millions depend on agriculture 
    for employment. Proper agricultural practices are crucial to maintain ecosystem health and and protect 
    natural resources. As population continues to grow, and climate change is an increasing concern, the need 
    for sustainable agricultural processes are at an all time high.

C02 production from agriculture is a significant contributor to climate change, making it a key concern for enviromental 
sustainability. Agriculture is estimated to be responsible for between one quarter and one thrid of the worlds
greenhouse gas emissions, with carbon dioxide being a primary contributor. Agricultures emissions stem mainly from
soil management processes, fossil fuel consumption in farming operations and the transportation required in the production
and distribution of its products. Deforstation for for agricultural purposes releases C02 stored in trees and soil,
increasing atmospheric C02 levels, and practices such as tilling the soil disrupt soil health, leading to the release 
of more C02 into the atmosphere. As global food demands rise it is increasingly important that agricultural practices mitigate
the amount of greenhouse gasses that are released into the atmosphere, to contribute to a more resilient agricultural system
