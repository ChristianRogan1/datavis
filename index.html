<h1>Global Agriculture</h1>
<p>Agriculture is vital for sustaining human life and global economies. It provides nutrition and raw 
    materials needed for everyday life and industrial processes. Beyond its economic significance, 
    agriculture plays a critical role in rural developement and employment. Millions depend on agriculture 
    for employment. Proper agricultural practices are crucial to maintain ecosystem health and and protect 
    natural resources. As population continues to grow, and climate change is an increasing concern, the need 
    for sustainable agricultural processes are at an all time high.

C02 production from agriculture is a significant contributor to climate change, making it a key concern for enviromental 
sustainability. Agriculture is estimated to be responsible for between one quarter and one thrid of the worlds
greenhouse gas emissions, with carbon dioxide being a primary contributor. Agricultures emissions stem mainly from
soil management processes, fossil fuel consumption in farming operations and the transportation required in the production
and distribution of its products. Deforstation for for agricultural purposes releases C02 stored in trees and soil,
increasing atmospheric C02 levels, and practices such as tilling the soil disrupt soil health, leading to the release 
of more C02 into the atmosphere. As global food demands rise it is increasingly important that agricultural practices mitigate
the amount of greenhouse gasses that are released into the atmosphere, to contribute to a more resilient agricultural system

    Agricultural crop types vary widely across different regions of the world due to climate, soil conditions, and cultural
     preferences. In tropical areas, crops like rice and sugarcane dominate due to high temperatures and 
     rainfall. Temperate regions are ideal for growing grains such as wheat, barley, and corn, as well as vegetables and 
     fruits like apples and potatoes. In arid and semi-arid areas, drought-resistant crops like sorghum, millet, and certain 
     legumes thrive. Coastal and river regions support rice paddies, while high-altitude regions often grow hardy crops like oats, 
     quinoa, and root vegetables suited for cooler climates.

    Extreme weather events in Australia such as droughts, floods, bushfires and heatwaves can have profound economic impacts on 
    the agricultural sector. Climate change has heightened the frequency and severity of these events, leading to substantial financial
    loss for for farmers and the agricultural industry as a whole. Droughts are particuraly detrimental, resulting in reduced crop yields
    due to decreased irrigation access. Prolonged drought coniditions can lead to significant declines in crop production. Irrigation access
    is crucial for sustaining agricultural productivity. There are many factors that can affect irrigation access such as extreme weather events and
    competing demands from urban and industrial sectors. Improving irrigation efficciency and water management practices is essential for enhancing
    agricultural resilience, maximising crop yields and ensuring sustainable water use in the face of climate change and population growth
